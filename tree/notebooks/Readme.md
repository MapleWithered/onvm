Read me:

    1- tree-data_extraction.ipynb
       extract the data from data file to dataset file, pay attention to the pre_seq function
    2- tree.ipynb
       First glance of data structure, note that for resource stimulus, we did the different tress testing on each VNF
    3- tree-combine-csv.ipynb
       combine several paralle csv file into one, and reorder the index: generate load-stimulus-global/resource-stimulus-global
    4- tree-load-stimulus.ipynb
       data process using the csv file generated from the step 3
    5- tree-resource-stimulus.ipynb
       data process using the csv file generated from the step 3
      
Have fun again!
